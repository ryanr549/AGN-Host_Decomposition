This folder consists of 3 parts: field_cat.fits, PSF, dataset_all
field_cat.fits: source catalogue
	ID: source ID
	RA: J2000 right ascesion
	DEC: J2000 declination
	z: redshift
	Mbh: log(bh_mass/sun_mass)
	Mbh_err_pos: positive measurement error
	Mbh_err_neg: negative measurement error
	F140W ~ F850LP_CLEAR2L: dataset name of observational data in different band; nan means no observation is this band;
dataset_all: contains all the dataset folder, each folder contains a drizzled science image;
PSF: contains the stacked point-spread-function of different band for different targets;
